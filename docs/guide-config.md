Renative configs are one of the most powerful feature of ReNative platform.

Their format is `renative.*.json`

They form the bedrock of ReNative "DNA" philosophy.

When you create new project `rnv new` there is only one single file generated `renative.json`.

Just like the DNA it contains core information about your project, structure, templates, platforms etc.

Once you trigger your first `rnv ...` command this file is used to generate everything on demand
